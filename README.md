# FunLabyrinthe in Scala

This is a reimplementation in Scala of my long-lived project [FunLabyrinthe](http://www.funlabyrinthe.com/).
The aim of this reimplementation is to make it more portable, especially in three areas:

* Executable on Linux and Mac OS, in addition to Windows
* Thanks to [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/), the runner is also executable in browsers
* Maybe make the runner executable on mobile devices

I do not expect this project to reach maturity before a long time.
The existing software can be used until then!
